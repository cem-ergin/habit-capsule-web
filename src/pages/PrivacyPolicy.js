      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
      <p>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or contact details.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Photos and Media</h3>
      <p>
        The App requests access to your device’s photo gallery solely to allow you to select and use photos when creating
        collages.
      </p>
      <p>
        All photos and collages remain stored locally on your device and are never uploaded, transmitted, or stored on
        any external server.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
      <p>
        To improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience, we use Google Firebase Analytics. Firebase may
        automatically collect non-personal and aggregated information, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>app interactions such as feature usage and button taps</li>
        <li>device type and operating system version</li>
        <li>approximate location (country or region only)</li>
        <li>app performance metrics and crash diagnostics</li>
        <li>screen views and session duration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, subscription-related events and entitlement status may be processed through RevenueCat for
        purchase verification and subscription management purposes.
      </p>
      <p>This data does not directly identify you and is used solely to improve the App.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Advertising</h3>
      <p>The App does not display personalized advertising and does not collect advertising identifiers such as IDFA.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <p>The App offers optional weekly, monthly, and yearly subscription plans.</p>
      <p>All purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store.</p>
      <p>
        To manage subscriptions, verify purchase status, and grant access to premium features, the App uses RevenueCat,
        a third-party subscription management service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not access, store, or process any payment or credit card information. All payment details are handled
        exclusively by Apple.
      </p>
      <p>You may manage or cancel your subscriptions at any time through your App Store account settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Your photos, collages, and saved content remain stored locally on your device.</p>
      <p>
        We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, loss, or
        misuse.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You may revoke photo gallery permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>

      <p>When the App is uninstalled, all locally stored data is permanently deleted from your device.</p>
